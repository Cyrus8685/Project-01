## Description

This project is a website that provides options for internet plans and allows customers to select a plan that fits their needs. The options are laid out in a straightforward way that gives customers the ability to compare each plan and select one that fits their needs and budget. When they have selected one it will show a confirmation page and send them an email confirmation as well. This makes it easier for customers to select an internet plan without having to call their internet provider.   


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

In order to use this site users must input their address and verify that it is within the range covered by the internet provider. If their address is within the coverage range then the user will be able to choose one of three plans and be prompted to enter their email. After selecting a plan users will be taken to a confirmation page showing which plan they have selected. They will also receive a confirmation email showing their selection.
